## Wellcome to my github page
**Hi, I'm Sara!** :clap:
I graduated with a master's degree in Software Engineering. Over the last four years, I have focused on studying software development and have completed various projects encompassing both backend and frontend development. During this journey, I began my career as a full-stack developer at Software Quality Lab while pursuing my master's degree, where I worked on developing desktop-based software. I am passionate about continuing to pursue my career as a software developer.
